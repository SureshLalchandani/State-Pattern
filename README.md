Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

- Implemented State Pattern Using AirportSecurity (Context Class), AirportStateI (State Inteface), LowRisk, HighRisk, ModerateRisk classes as different states classes inherited from AirportStateI Interface. 

- Implemented SecurityFactors class as the Controller of State Pattern. This class parse the input file and calculate Average Traffic and Prohibited Items and then send message to context class for State checking.

- Context class calls the tightenOrlosen method on current Sate object and gets the new state.

- Depending on the State, printing a String that shows the list of operations performed on particular state.

- No Special Data Structure is used in this assignment.
